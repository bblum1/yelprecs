## How to Run Code

After cloning the repository, run 'jupyter notebook' in the yelprecs directory. Navigate to the "Final_Code.ipynb' file, and open this.

There are two main sections to the code. The first section loads the large review.json data file, and DOES NOT NEED TO BE RAN. In order to avoid running this section, we exported the reviews and star ratings we were planning to use into a 'stars.txt' and 'reviews.txt' file.

In order to run our code, simply scroll down to 'Section 2', and run each cell in order.
